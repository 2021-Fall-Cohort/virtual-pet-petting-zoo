Welcome to the Virtual Pet Shelter! Fun zoo game by Ty, Britney, Ali


The zoo app is a virtual pet game that will keep you occupied for a long time. You may engage in a range of enjoyable activities with your pet, like playing with them and feeding them. The player will be given one pet at a time to populate the pet shelter. A pet has a name chosen by the user, as well as 5-6 characteristics.

The user is then presented with a list of activities that they can do with their pets individually or in groups: The app utilises the tick method every time a user performs an action. Except for one thing: displaying pet information does not activate the tick method. 
A list of characteristics can be displayed individually or before each action to show the user the current values.
Your only goal is to look after all of the virtual pets you have, so good luck!
